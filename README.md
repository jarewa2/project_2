### **Project proposal**

In the interest of the current issues regarding global warming we would like to leverage machine learning algorithms to predict weather patterns and occurences. 



### **Finding Data**


Brainstorming ideas:
- comparing rainfall between two or more cities (leverage)
- compare historical data sets for cities and predict weather for week of presentation


Static datasets:

[Historical Hourly Weather Data 2012-2017](https://www.kaggle.com/selfishgene/historical-hourly-weather-data?select=wind_direction.csv)


[NYC Weather](https://www.kaggle.com/eaturner/nycweather)


APIs:

[Weather API](https://openweathermap.org/api)



### **Model training & Evaluation**
